# Net48MvcRenshu

I'll practice developing an ASP.NET MVC system with .NET Framework 4.8 instead of "short-life" ASP.NET Core MVC.

TODO:

- [ ] Model
  - [ ] Model includes Form data and entity
  - [ ] File upload
- [ ] View
  - [ ] Layout
  - [ ] Partial views
  - [ ] Use data from parent form model
  - [ ] jQuery UI dialog with Ajax
  - [ ] Print friendly
  - [ ] Validation (I can use model annotation...?)
- [ ] Controller
  - [ ] File download
  - [ ] Post-redirect-get
  - [ ] Common process  
      Probably I should implement a base controller that has OnActionExecuting.
- [ ] Entity and CRUD
  - [X] Generating model class (Database First)
  - [ ] Single Table
  - [ ] One-To-Many Single primary key Tables
  - [ ] Composite primary key Tables
  - [ ] Optimistic concurrency control with rowversion/timestamp
- [ ] Other
  - [ ] Logging
